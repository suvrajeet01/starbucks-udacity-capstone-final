# Starbucks Offer Recommendation System

## Introduction

This project was done as a requirement for the Udacity Data Scientist
Nanodegree. The goal of the project is to use the transactional,
customer and offer data to provide offer recommendations to Starbucks
customers. The data was obtained by a simulation of the Starbucks
mobile app in which customers receive and view offers, and pay their
drinks in the stores.
